I read about Support Vector Machine Algorithm
SVM is useful for classification, regression and anomaly detection.
It seems that the SVM algorithm needs to be given a set of data-set examples. The alogrithm then builds a model that distinguishes new data set into either one category or another i.e. between the 'training' set and 'non-training' set.
This algorithm can perhaps be used in the following areas:
1. detecting suspicious activity on a credit card
2. detecting insider trading activity 
3. detecting failing financial health of a public company in a specific industry
